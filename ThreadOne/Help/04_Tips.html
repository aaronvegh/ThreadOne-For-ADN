    <h1>Tips and Tricks</h1>
    <p>Take control of ThreadOne with these tips and tricks.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Navigation Tips</strong><br/>
    You can use the keyboard to navigate the Chat list. Use the up and down arrow keys to select a message in the list. Hit the right arrow on a selected chat to view the messages.</p>
    
    <p>In the Message view, you can use a two-finger swipe gesture (left to right) to move back to the Chat view.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Customization</strong><br/>
    You can change the look of ThreadOne from the Preferences. Go to ThreadOne > Preferences (or hit Command-,) and visit the "Themes" tab. Choose between the Light and Dark theme. Your choice will reflect immediately.</p>
    
    <p>You can also change the sounds used in ThreadOne. In the Sounds tab, you can choose between two sound sets. You can also choose whether sounds will play for all message sending, or just as Notifications (you'll hear a sound when a message arrives, when ThreadOne isn't the active application).</p>
